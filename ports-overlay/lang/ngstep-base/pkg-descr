The NgSTEP Base library implements the Foundation portion of the OpenStep
specification, jointly developed by NeXT and Sun.  It aims to provide
compatibility with extensions added by Apple's implementation of this standard:
Cocoa.  The Foundation framework provides the standard library for Objective-C,
including collections, operating system interfaces, and so on.
