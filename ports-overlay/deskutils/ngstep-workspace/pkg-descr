Workspace is the official NgSTEP workspace manager. It is a clone of
NeXT's workspace manager and already ready for daily usage. Workspace is
probably one of the most useful and usable workspace managers available on
any platform, owing to its well-designed interface and the natural,
consistent design that it inherits from the NgSTEP framework.
